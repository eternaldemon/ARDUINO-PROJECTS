WHen you press the button for the first time, the system gets armed and if an obstacle is placed in between the laser and LDR it starts the alarm.
When you press the button for the second time, the system gets disarmed and if an obstacle is placed in between laser and LDR , nothing happens.

THe process repeats itself if you press the button again and again accordingly.
Happy Coding.
