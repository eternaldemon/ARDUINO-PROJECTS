HOME AUTOMATION SYSTEM USING ARDUINO AND BLUETOOTH MODULE (HC-05 or HC-06)

CONNECTIONS :

1. Arduino Uno to Relay and Breadboard

	Arduino 5V --> Breadboard Power Line
	Arduino GND --> Breadboard GND Line
	Relay GND --> Breadboard GND
	Relay VCC --> Breadboard Power
	Relay IN1 --> Arduino Digital Pin 2
	Relay IN2 --> Arduino Digital Pin 3

2. Bluetooth Module HC-05 to Arduino 

	VCC --> Breadboard Power Line
	GND --> Breadboard GND Line
	RX  --> TX of Arduino 
	TX  --> RX of Arduino 

3. Relay to Appliance/Device/LED

	NO1/NC1*  --> Positive Terminal of Power Supply
	COM1     --> Positive Terminal of Device 

	and Negative Terminal of Device connects to Negative Terminal of Power Supply
*Do not use N01 and NC1 simultaneously. Use one at a time.
Similarly connect the 2nd Device to NO2/NC2,COM2 and Power Supply.
